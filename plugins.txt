A plugin needs to be placed in ./plugins/ folder. (And be named
<name>.tcl)

It needs two procs:

proc init<name> {} {
	#runs at startup
}

proc menu<name> {} {
	#add command to Plugins menu
	#example
	.mainmenu.menuPlugins add command -label "Plugin foo"\
			-command {::foo::bar args}
}

there are four global variables that can be used

repaint (called when prog needs repaint)
update (called when a move has been made)
savefile (called at closing time, to save settings)
create (used if plugin creates a window on startup)

they are called with 
	addCommand <variable> <command>
	removeCommand <variable> <command>
	
	example
	addCommand repaint "::foo::bar args"
	removeCommand repaint "::foo::bar args"
	
(don't forget the namespace in the commands)
make sure to remove the command again if window is closed
also make sure not to cause an error if repaint or update are called
after destruction, there can be delayed calls
use e.g.
if {[winfo exists .foo] == 0} {return}
at beginning of proc


everything else should be in its own namespace
